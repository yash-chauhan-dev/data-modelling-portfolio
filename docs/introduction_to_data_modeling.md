# Introduction to Data Modeling

Data modeling is the foundational process of visually structuring data, capturing key entities, relationships, and rules within a system. It provides a blueprint for database design, promoting data consistency, integrity, and usability across applications. 

## Key Types of Data Models

1. **Conceptual Data Models**: Define high-level entities and relationships for initial planning.
2. **Logical Data Models**: Specify attributes, primary keys, and more detailed relationships.
3. **Physical Data Models**: Optimize the database structure for specific systems, including tables and indexes.

Data modeling facilitates clear communication between business users, analysts, and developers, bridging requirements with technical design.
